👋 Hi, I'm @Wasasita, a student in university.

I'm interested in seeing what this app can do.
I'm currently learning how to code with C.
I'm looking to create new proyects of my own after getting the hang of this app.
To reach me just gmail me at analaura.larosap@gmail.com, I might take 1-2 days to respond.
